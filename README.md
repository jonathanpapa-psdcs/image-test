(Some Notes on Titling: I almost chose "The SeedSigner Manifesto" as a grab-your-attention title with a little bit of cheekiness baked in. As I think more and more about bitcoin custody and how it has evolved over time, the term "manifesto" seems increasingly appropriate to use for some of the ideas that underlie this guide. Manifestos commonly challenge conventional ways of thinking and can be threatening to incumbents and status quo beliefs.

As I view the longer arc of bitcoin custody, I think of it in three epochs. The first is the epoch characterized by Bitcoin Core and paper wallets, Core being of course the earliest way to store bitcoin, and paper wallets being representative of early creative attempts at facilitating storage with improved security assurances.

I consider the second epoch to be the hardware wallet era; that is, the era of proprietary, USB-connected, secure element equipped, separate hardware devices that represented a big advance in bitcoin custodial security assurances, but with significant compromises, some of which involve varying degrees of reliance on third parties. The second epoch was facilitated by the hierarchical deterministic wallet and the BIP39 seed phrase standards.

In my view, the third custody epoch is being ushered in by the PSBT (partially signed bitcoin transaction) standard, the implementation and refinement of multi-signature wallet standards, and the ongoing re-thinking of how we can increase the separation between devices/software that interact with the bitcoin protocol, and devices/software that interact with private keys. I believe that stateless signing devices (like SeedSigner) which leverage transparently airgapped communication (read QR-exchange protocol rather than NFC), with a focus on facilitating user-accessible multi-signature wallet use, will emerge as emblematic of this third epoch. The DIY approach of SeedSigner, leveraging general purpose hardware and Free-And-Open-Source code, will also serve to shift control away from purveyors of purpose-built, proprietary hardware wallets, moving that power back into the hands of users.

This "manifesto" then seeks to advance the idea that with the right mix of design inputs, users can have access to simple, user-friendly bitcoin self-custody, with reasonably solid security assurances, using inexpensive, discreetly-acquired hardware, & FOSS code.)
